This project loads a list of countries, with their regions and additional details.

This version of the project is without a single web page. It has different pages to show the information (country, region, SubRegion).

Here is not present the filtering process.

The backend is consuming  different endpoints provided by the countries API (All countries, specific country, specific region, specific SubRegion). 

Most of the process takes action on the backend.
